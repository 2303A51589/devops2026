This audit includes reviewing logs for unusual activity, anomaly detection, documenting findings, and taking necessary actions.\n",
        "*   **Preventative Measures Implementation**:\n",
        "    *   `pre-commit` and `detect-secrets` were successfully installed and configured within the repository environment.\n",
        "    *   Initial attempts to verify `detect-secrets` were met with several troubleshooting steps, including resolving baseline generation errors, addressing `detect-secrets` plugin `TypeError` issues, and correcting the simulated sensitive data pattern.\n",
        "    *   Ultimately, the `detect-secrets` pre-commit hook successfully blocked a simulated commit containing a `GitHub Token` pattern, demonstrating its effectiveness in preventing sensitive data from entering the repository.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Prioritize Manual Audit and Vigilance**: While preventative measures are in place, thoroughly complete the manual security audit for past exposure and educate all team members on secure credential management and the use of the new `pre-commit` hooks.\n",
        "*   **Refine `detect-secrets` Configuration**: Conduct further testing with various types of sensitive data relevant to the project to ensure `detect-secrets` effectively covers all potential secret patterns. Regularly update `detect-secrets` and `pre-commit` hooks to benefit from the latest security improvements.\n"
